# Timely Migration Landing Page - Complete Implementation Prompt

Transform the current landing page into a high-converting Timely migration page with the following complete overhaul:

## HERO SECTION REPLACEMENT

Replace the entire hero section with:

**Headline:** "Leaving Timely? We'll Pay for Your Move."  
**Subheadline:** "Keep your Tyro. Migrate your data. Get 6 months FREE when you switch."  
**Supporting text:** "Join 47 Australian salons who switched from Timely this month"

Add two CTA buttons:
- **Primary:** "Start My Free Migration" (large, prominent)
- **Secondary:** "Book 10-Min Demo" (outline style)

Below CTAs add trust indicators in a horizontal bar:
```
✓ Keep Your Tyro Terminal   ✓ 24-Hour Migration   ✓ No Setup Fees   ✓ Australian Support
```

## URGENT: ADD COUNTDOWN TIMER

Immediately below hero, add a red alert bar with countdown timer:
```
⏰ Timely Switcher Deal Expires Friday, Nov 29 at 11:59 PM
[Countdown showing days:hours:minutes:seconds]
```

## PAIN AGITATION SECTION

Create new section titled **"Still Fighting With Timely?"** with two columns:

**Left column - Timely Problems:**
- ❌ Random crashes during peak hours
- ❌ Clunky interface your staff hates  
- ❌ Inventory tracking that doesn't work
- ❌ Support tickets that take days
- ❌ Price increases with no improvements

**Right column - HEYA Solutions:**
- ✅ Rock-solid reliability, 99.9% uptime
- ✅ Intuitive design staff learn in minutes
- ✅ Real-time inventory that actually works
- ✅ 30-minute support response guarantee
- ✅ Locked pricing, no surprises

## MIGRATION PROCESS SECTION

**Title:** "We Make Switching Painless"  
**Subtitle:** "Most salons are live within 24 hours"

Create a visual timeline with 5 steps:
1. **Export from Timely** (we guide you)
2. **Import to HEYA** (automatic)
3. **Keep your Tyro** (no new hardware)
4. **Train your team** (one session)
5. **Go live** (without missing a booking)

Add reassurance text: *"Our migration specialist handles everything. You don't lose a single customer record or booking history."*

## COMPARISON TABLE

Create a detailed comparison table:

| Feature | Timely | HEYA |
|---------|--------|------|
| Monthly Cost | $89+ | $49 (locked forever) |
| Setup Fee | $299 | $0 |
| Tyro Integration | Problematic | Seamless |
| System Crashes | Daily | Never |
| Support Response | 2-3 days | 30 minutes |
| Data Export | Complicated | One click |
| Free Trial | 14 days | 30 days |

## THE OFFER SECTION

Create a highlighted box with the deal:

**Title:** 🎉 Limited Time: Timely Refugee Special

**The Deal:**

Add scarcity: **"Only 11 spots remaining at this price"**  
Add urgency: **"Offer expires Friday - Timely won't get better, we will"**

**CTA:** "Claim My 6 Free Months"

## SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

**Title:** "Salons That Escaped Timely"

Add 3 testimonial cards:

1. > "Switched from Timely last month. Migration took one afternoon. My staff actually thanked me."  
   > **- Sarah Chen, Luxe Hair Studio, South Yarra**

2. > "Same Tyro terminal, 10x better software. Why did I wait so long?"

3. > "Finally, a POS that doesn't crash during Saturday rush. Revenue up 20% since switching."  
   > **- Michael Torres, Gentlemen's Grooming, CBD**

## ROI CALCULATOR SECTION

**Title:** "See Your Savings"

Create an interactive calculator:
- Timely cost: $89/month = $1,068/year
- HEYA cost: $49/month - 6 FREE = $294 first year
- **First year savings: $774**
- **3-year savings: $1,584**

Add text: *"Plus: No crashes, better support, happier staff = priceless"*

## FAQ SECTION - TIMELY SPECIFIC

## HEYA PRODUCT SHOWCASE SECTION

**Title:** "See Why HEYA is Better"  
**Subtitle:** "Not just better than Timely - better than anything else"

Add a three-column showcase of HEYA's interface:

**Customer Database** 
- Current feature + "Import all your Timely customers with history intact"

**Payment Processing**
- Current feature + "Your Tyro just works - no integration headaches"

Three CTAs side by side:

   - Product screenshots/mockups (add Timely comparison captions)
   - Core feature list (reframe as Timely improvements)
   - Security badges and trust signals
   - Any working forms or CTAs

2. **Modify these existing elements:**
   - Change generic benefits to Timely-specific pain solutions
   - Update pricing to show the 6-month free offer
   - Adjust testimonials to mention switching from Timely

3. **Add these new Timely-specific elements:**
   - Comparison table (Timely vs HEYA)
   - Migration timeline visualization
   - Countdown timer for Friday deadline
   - Tyro compatibility badges

4. **Balance the messaging:**
   - 60% Timely migration focus
   - 40% HEYA benefits and features
   - Always connect features back to Timely pain points

Make this page impossible to leave without taking action. Every element should drive toward claiming the 6 months free offer before Friday.
